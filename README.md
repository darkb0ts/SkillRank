# SkillRank
Check a Resume score by Job Skill and Job Description

Project Description

SkillRank is a project designed to streamline and enhance the recruitment process by leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for automated resume scoring. It utilizes a robust architecture built on cutting-edge technologies:

FastAPI: A high-performance backend framework for building efficient RESTful APIs.

Redis: A fast in-memory data store employed as a message broker for queuing and distributing resume processing tasks.

Docker: Containerization technology that ensures consistent and scalable deployments across environments.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Techniques for extracting relevant information from resumes, including skills, experience, and education.

Machine Learning (ML): A pre-trained model is used to analyze the extracted features from resumes and predict a score indicating the candidate's suitability based on your criteria.

Celery: A distributed task queue that manages and facilitates asynchronous processing of resume evaluation tasks.

Key Features

Improved Efficiency: Automates initial resume screening, saving recruiters valuable time and effort.
Reduced Bias: Objective scoring based on skills and experience extracted through NLP, minimizing subjective bias.
Better Fit: Helps identify candidates whose skills and experience closely align with job requirements.
Scalability and Flexibility: Designed for easy scaling as resume volumes increase and adapts to evolving recruitment needs.
